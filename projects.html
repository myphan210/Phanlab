                <h3>Environmental dust as a virus vector</h3>
                    <p>We often overlook the role of environmental dust/air as a vector for virus transmission. We demonstrated that dust collected downstream of Dutch chicken farms carried nearly the same viruses that are found in the chickens themselves (Kwok et al., 2022).
                    The environmental, virus and host factors that control the virus transmission in dust/air are under active investigation. 
                    Our lab investigates: what viral pathogens are circulating in the dust/air in different environments, can we use the virus genomics surveillance of dust/air as a proxy for the virus surveillance in the community, what factors may influence the transmission?

                <h3>Patterns of viruses in mosquitoes</h3> 
                <p>Outdoor activities in Phoenix, Arizona, can lead to mosquito encounters. Mosquitoes are well established as transmitters of serious human pathogens such as Yellow Fever virus, West Nile virus, Dengue virus and others. 
                    In addition, there are a broad range of endogenous mosquito viruses (i.e. insect viruses) that may influence the mosquitoâ€™s carriage and transmission of the serious human viral pathogens. 
                    We are using viral metagenomic sequencing combined with bioinformatics analyses to document the host species and diversity of viruses infecting mosquito populations in Phoenix and in Maricopa county (Arizona).

                <h3>Viral metagenomics sequencing of clinical samples to identify missed diagnoses </h3> 
                <p>Clinical diagnostics can fail to detect viruses infecting patients. Two main factors were identified: (1) Unexpected viruses causing the disease - many viruses can cause pneumonia or diarrhea but are not routinely
                tested our study identified unexpected and untested viruses that may be involved in the disease; (2) Primer mismatch in routine molecular diagnostic panels can result in false negative diagnostic results. 
                    We found good examples of both scenarios and provided useful solutions in previous study (Phan et al. 2022).

                <h3>Environmental surveillance (sewage) for disease monitoring </h3> 
                <p>Wastewater or sewage provides a rich matrix to investigate and monitor pathogens circulating in a large community. Historically, these samples have been used to monitor the drug use in the population. 
                    The application of deep sequencing and computational analyses has allowed the documentation of pathogens infecting multiple hosts (human, animals, plants, bacteria) circulating in the community (Nieuwenhuijse et al. 2022). 
                    The data also provides patterns of pathogen presence and early warning signal of potential pathogen outbreaks in the locality.

                <p>Viral genomic sequencing combined with a detailed local database is a powerful tool for tracking the population movement of some types of viruses. We used these methods to help the public health response and control
