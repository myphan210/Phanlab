#                <h3>Environmental dust as a virus vector</h3>
                <p>We often overlook the role of environmental dust/air as a vector for virus transmission. We demonstrated that dust collected downstream of Dutch chicken farms carried nearly the same viruses that are found in the chickens themselves (Kwok et al., 2022).
                    The environmental, virus and host factors that control the virus transmission in dust/air are under active investigation. 
                    Our lab investigates: what viral pathogens are circulating in the dust/air in different environments, can we use the virus genomics surveillance of dust/air as a proxy for the virus surveillance in the community, what factors may influence the transmission?

                <h3>Patterns of viruses in mosquitoes</h3> 
                <p>Outdoor activities in Phoenix, Arizona, can lead to mosquito encounters. Mosquitoes are well established as transmitters of serious human pathogens such as Yellow Fever virus, West Nile virus, Dengue virus and others. 
                    In addition, there are a broad range of endogenous mosquito viruses (i.e. insect viruses) that may influence the mosquitoâ€™s carriage and transmission of the serious human viral pathogens. 
                    We are using viral metagenomic sequencing combined with bioinformatics analyses to document the host species and diversity of viruses infecting mosquito populations in Phoenix and in Maricopa county (Arizona).
